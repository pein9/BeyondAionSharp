/// <b>It matters under a virtual clock.</b> <c>BossAiHarness</c> advances a scheduler by minutes in a
/// few milliseconds of real time, so every one of those timestamps stayed where it was: cooldowns never
/// elapsed, <c>CanUseNextSkill</c> stayed false once a skill had set a delay, and an npc's own skill
/// rotation could not run. Pins that drove a clock past a cooldown were quietly testing a world where
/// no cooldown ever passes — which is how two attempts to pin a cast cadence came back saying nothing.
