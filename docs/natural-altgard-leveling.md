# Natural Altgard leveling leg (proposal)

**Status: proposal, awaiting the operator's approval (2026-09-29).** Nothing here is built yet.
Once the list, the order and the decisions below are approved, this document gets a TODO
list and a loop protocol like [the Ascension bridge](natural-ascension-altgard.md).

## Goal

Take the level 10 Cleric from the bridge endpoint (bound at Altgard Fortress) through
Altgard's quests to the end of the zone, the way a player would:
- work one quest hub at a time, starting with the fortress, the main town;
- pick up every approved quest at a hub as soon as its level and prerequisites allow;
- come back for the ones that open later.

It starts from the saved snapshots, not from a new character:
- SIM: `sim-snapshot.ps1 -Action Restore -Name altgard`;
- LIVE: `run/na27-live/na27-live-a3/altgard-live-dump.sql.gz`.

It follows the same rules as the bridge: the Java source is the spec, no server content is
added, each step is proved once, and deaths are recorded but are not failures (OD-12).

## How the list was built

The data comes from:
- `parity-artifacts/e2e/obtainable-quests.json` (the checked-in availability classifier);
- `scripts/e2e/compile-quest-plans.py --zone Altgard` (gates, prerequisites, template
  NPCs and rewards);
- the custom C# handlers under `src/Aion.GameServer/Handlers/Quest/altgard/` (start NPCs,
  talk and kill events, item use, timers, escorts);
- the spawn, zone, NPC, item, gatherable and goods-list data.

C# matches Java for these handlers, since they are ports.

Altgard has **141 Asmodian quests**:
- **107 are obtainable** under the classifier;
- 20 have no handler;
- 12 are disabled (level 99 or event quests);
- 2 are unreachable.

Of the 107, this proposal:
- **includes 85**, among them the Altgard campaign missions Q24011–Q24013;
- lists 4 [Group] quests in the route, pending AL-2;
- asks you about 8 more: the 4 [Gather] quests, Q2147, and the level 20 missions
  Q24014–Q24016;
- excludes the other 10, with the reasons below.

That makes 89 quests in the route tables.

## Decisions for you

| # | Question | Options | My recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| AL-1 | **Where does the leg end?** | (a) when every approved quest is done, at whatever level that is. Quest rewards total about 1.75M XP for the core list, so kills included the Cleric lands around **level 18–19**. (b) (a), then hunt to **level 20**. (c) (b), plus the level 20 missions Q24014–Q24016, which need the **Haramel** (300200000) and **Bregirun** (320030000) instances. | **(b)**. Stop at level 20 with the zone done; the instances start the next leg, as Ishalgen stopped before Ascension. |
| AL-2 | **[Group] quests** Q2277, Q2280, Q2281, Q2282. Their targets are EXPERT-rank "brutal Black Claw" monsters, level 16–20, with 2.7k–4.6k HP; ordinary SEASONED monsters here have 2.3k–3.1k. Q2283 "Report to Pandaemonium" needs Q2282. | include solo, or skip | **Include**, attempted solo at the target's level or above (Salvation, the heal over time and the Anti-Shock shield are for this). Deaths are recorded. |
| AL-3 | **[Gather] quests** Q2250 Kandula (Essencetapping 45), Q2275 Krimer (55), Q2276 Horto (75), Q2297 Blicora (85). The bot has Essencetapping of about 15 from Ishalgen, so this means a gathering grind. | skip all; include Q2250 and Q2275 (grind to 55); include all four (grind to 85) | **Skip for this leg.** Gathering levels come with the next leg's gathering work. |
| AL-4 | **Q2147 "Treasure Seek"** needs Lohaban's Treasure, which only Lohaban (203689), a *reward* vendor paid in quest coins, sells. The only coin quest here is the repeatable [Coin] Q2293. | skip, or add a coin loop | **Skip.** Its prerequisite Q2146 is still included. |
| AL-5 | **Pandaemonium trips:** Q2258 (Lindhelm), Q2278 (Cavalorn, Balder) and Q2283 (Vidar) need NPCs in Pandaemonium. | include (take the teleporter, which costs Kinah), or skip | **Include**, using the bridge's teleporter code. |

## Proposed quest list and order

The route goes hub by hub. Within a hub the bot takes every approved quest it is eligible
for. Anything gated by level or a prerequisite is picked up on a later pass. The listed
order is a plan, not a script: at run time the decision engine chooses from the client's
view, as in Ishalgen. Levels are the shipped `minlevel_permitted`. "After" means another
quest must be finished first.

## Excluded, with the evidence

| Quest | Name | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2144, 2145 | [Manastone Bundle] Cook the Books, Cheap Crates | **Manastone** exchanges: they need manastones (167000258/260/265) that no source gives. Repeatable 255 times. |

| 2216 | Knot Your Average Message | Starts from a random drop: the MuMu Grass Knot drops at 3% from MuMu Farmers ("Named Quest-Start Item" rule). Excluded as in Ishalgen; the drop is left alone. |
| 2228, 2274, 2296 | A Thorn in Its Side, Black Claw Baton, A Bill Found in a Box | Each starts from an item (the Tanning Knife, Chieftain's Baton, A Bill Found in a Box) that **nothing** in Java or C# produces. Unobtainable, like Ishalgen's Q2107. |
| 2293 | [Coin] Mutated Spirits | Repeatable 255 times and gives no XP (a coin loop). |
| 2217, 2285 | | Unreachable: the classifier finds their prerequisites unobtainable. |

| 80005, 80142, 80143, 80262 | | Event quests. |

| 24010 | Suthran's Orders | Already done by the bridge. |

## What the bot has to learn for this leg

Taken from the list above and from NA-23's findings. After approval these become the
TODO items.

1. **The quest-hub engine for Altgard.** A route planner over hubs driven by the approved
   list, like the Ishalgen decision engine, with level gates, prerequisites and "come back
   later". The zone becomes the journey contract.
2. **Leaving the fortress.** NA-23 found that a navmesh route from the obelisk to open
   ground is `GeometryRejected`, probably at the gate. This has to be solved first, because
   every hub except the fortress lies outside.
3. **New quest mechanics:**
   - escorts (Q2290, Q2284);
   - timed quests (Q2230, Q2263, Q2288);
   - spawned targets (Q2223 Infernus, Q2252 Minushan);
   - item use (Q2208 Mau Secret Remedy, Q24013 Hunter's Poison);
   - a poison effect (Q2213);
   - automatic campaign missions (Q24011–Q24013);
   - Pandaemonium round trips (Q2258, Q2278, Q2283).
4. **Cleric fighting at level 12–20.** This includes SEASONED and EXPERT targets, the
   first real use of the Anti-Shock shield, Salvation and the serums (NA-23 could not
   trigger them), and the patrol wait tuned for helpers that do not move (an NA-23 finding).
5. **Level 12–20 skills and gear.** New Cleric skills as they are learned, gear upgrades
   from quest rewards, the help-item bands at 20 (OD-13), and vendor restocks at hubs.
6. **Acceptance** once, as before: one SIM run from the `altgard` snapshot, the full
   checklist, then one isolated LIVE run from the LIVE dump.

## Blocked / questions for the operator
